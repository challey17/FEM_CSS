Flexbox

Propertries for flex container/parent:

    display: flex | inline-flex;

    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

	flex-wrap: wrap | nowrap | wrap-reverse;
        flex-wrap is awesome! Flex-wrap sets items as wide as their content,
	    when content doesn't fit on one ling, items wrap to another line.
	    As screen size decreases, more items will come down onto new rows

	flex-flow (shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap)

	justify-content (main axis): flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
        space-between - browser adds equal amount of space between elements-NOT ON BOTH SIDES ONLY between
        space-around - browser adds equal amount of space on LEFT AND RIGHT of each element
        space-evenly - browser adds equal amount of space between all elements and also side of viewport

	align-items (cross axis - adjust to individual sizes): flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
        baseline - wierd
        stretch - fills container or row
